<h1>Coordinate Tree</h1>
 
A data structure that enables the storage and search of points in two-dimensional space. It is implemeneted as a binary tree, where the nodes are partitioned based on their coordinates. The partitioning is done based on a comparator that alternates between comparing the x- and y-coordinates of the points on each level.
